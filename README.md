Addressing Class Imbalance in Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Ensemble Learning Techniques

Credit card fraud poses a persistent threat to financial institutions and consumers, necessitating advanced detection mechanisms to safeguard transactions and uphold confidence in digital payments. Identifying fraudulent activities swiftly is paramount to reducing economic losses and ensuring customer satisfaction.

This report examines a dataset of credit card transactions from European cardholders, spanning two days in September 2013. Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset comprises 284,807 transactions, with only 492 (0.172%) classified as fraudulent, highlighting a pronounced class imbalance that challenges conventional classification approaches.

Features V1 through V28 are principal components derived from a PCA transformation to protect sensitive information. The dataset includes two non-transformed features: Time, representing seconds elapsed since the first transaction, and Amount, indicating the transaction value. The target variable, Class, is binary, with one denoting fraud and 0 indicating legitimate transactions
